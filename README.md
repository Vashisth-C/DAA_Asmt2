Web Pages of assignments done as a part of coursework under Prof. Tathagatha Ray, BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. This assignment encompasses a visualisation for the dynamic porgramming algorithm for the RNA folding algorithm.

We have used a Flask App for this project. The languages used are HTML, CSS, C++, Python and Shell Scripting. Our Flask App runs on the 5000 port.

To run the project, follow the following steps:

    1) Enter the DAA_Asmt2 folder
    2) run the command
      "sudo chmod +x ./req.sh"
       to allow the shell script execution permissions
    	"./req.sh"
       to download all the packages and libraries required for running the application
    3) run the Flask Server on terminal in the path .\DAA_Asmt2 by entering
    	"python app.py"
       to start our Flask App
    4) visit 127.0.0.1:5000 and browse

Features added as a part of Visualization include: 
    1) The visualization takes an input in the form of a linear RNA sequence.
    2) The output is generated includes the Dot and Bracket Notation of the RNA Folding, the maximum optimal pairing, and the 2D structure.
    3) This 2D structure is obtained following the maximum possible pairs, and not the actual structure obtained for a similar RNA sequence in real life.
