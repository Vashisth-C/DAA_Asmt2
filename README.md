Web Pages of assignments done as a part of coursework under Prof. Tathagatha Ray, BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. This assignment encompasses a visualisation for the dynamic porgramming algorithm for the RNA folding algorithm.

We have used a Flask App for this project. The languages used are HTML, CSS and Python. Our Flask App runs on the 5000 port.

To run the project, follow the following steps:

    1) Enter the DAA_Asmt2 folder
    2) run the command
    	"pip install -r requirements.txt"
       to download all the packages and libraries required for running the application
    3) run the Flask Server on terminal in the path .\DAA_Asmt2 by entering
    	"python app.py"
       to start our Flask App
    4) visit 127.0.0.1:5000 and browse
